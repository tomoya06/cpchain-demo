# DEMO for XA

## GET STARTED

* Pull /dev branch and /server branch to local. Place them in seperate folder would be better. 
* /dev branch contains the website for demonstration. Just open index.html with your default browser.
* /server branch contains the server part. run `node ./index.js` in the containing folder. 
* The default trigger message is number 0-5, listening on COM4 for serial input.

## HOW TO EDIT

* The README in /dev branch teaches you how to use reveal.js, the main plugin used to edit the slides. Or visit its [HOMEPAGE](https://revealjs.com/) for further info. 
* In both /dev and /server branch, search the keyword `TODO:` within the project workspace for all the codes you should pay attention to, and, edit if necessary, before use it in practice. (In /dev, ignore but TODOs in **index.html** and **ws.js**)
